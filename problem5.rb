#Modules provide a namespace to group methods, constants and classes together.
#Unlike classes, they don't have instance variables.
#Math is a typical module in the sense that it has a bunch of methods to perform math operations
#but doesn't have any internal state like a class would have.

#More importantly modules allow multiple inheritance throught mixins.
#A single class can inherit methods from multiple modules.
#Enumerable is an example of how mixins can work.
